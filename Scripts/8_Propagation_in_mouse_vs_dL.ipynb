    "What we have in the dendrite is actually a digital effect of a chain of interconnected monostable oscillators. Monostable means it stays at rest until you push the button, when it makes a spike and goes back to rest until the next button. And that is our effect. A chain of monostable oscillators, where each can push the button of the next one. Each segment acts as one. The transmission loss translated as minimum spike that actually triggers the button, combined with the power of the spikes, as defined by the ion channel parameters, is what defines if boosting happens or not. That is why it is so robust. Because it is not a propagating voltage, it is a propagating trigger in a chain of digital things, with fixed voltage states. That is why it quickly gets regulated to a nominal voltage of 20mv or so. Of course there are the passive stuff in the background, so there is also something propagating, which makes the final shapes wider, but if you see notebook 7 bottom figure, the shape gets instantly wide, and then remains the same. This is not a passive propagation. There is the passive echo of the previous rearby segments, and a fresh local spike. The above mean that the propagation speed of the phenomenon depends only on the rise and fall time of the spike. Which is a huge argument in favor of ephys shape controlling the boosting effect already! However!, the fact that we use separate sets for soma and dendrites, or that we don't know what to do, is against us. I have a feeling that the speed will also heavily depend on the selected dL, which is very bad news in general. If I can show that the same hof behaves differently if I simulate with different dL settings, this means that correct or realistic dL is super important too. But here comes a limit of models. Because real life is an integral, and we approach it with sums."

    "The distinction between analog and digital is that analog is free in voltage and time. It can be anywhere at any given time.\n",
    "True digital is free in neither. Both voltage and time are quantized. And in electronics exist also the hybrids of \"fixed time, free voltage\" AM and with some imagination also FM (radio). But also the rarely used hybrid of fixed voltage free time, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta-sigma_modulation It was more popular when real digital was immature (the AM FM era).\n",
    "Neurons closest resemble this thing I believe. Delta-sigma modulation. Meaning timing is the most important aspect for the communication between cells. And this is an argument in favor of entrainment in general.\n",
    "Our lab teaches me that since we do not have perfect square pulses, maybe the shape, and specifically the rise and fall times and shapes that each cell presents might play a role in the response of the next cell. I would argue that what truly matters is the area under the spike, which is directly proportional to the power, and thus the ability to \"push the button\" of the next cell, and how strongly it does (given the transmission losses as well). So, there might be an analog communication because I can push weak and it gives 1 spike, or strong and it gives 5 (in accordance with delta-sigma modulation)."

    "Now, each segment in our simulation, is closely resembled in electronics as the monostable I mentioned. Real life monostable circuits also have an analog aspect in its pulse duration. You can make 1ms 100ms whatever. It also has rise and fall time specifications. In electronics we like them as fast and sharp as technology allows.
